> **A High-Performance, Modular, and Robust Framework for Entity Resolution using Large Language Models.**

---

## ✨ Key Features

*   **⚡ Parallel Execution**: Optimized with `ThreadPoolExecutor` for concurrent processing of entity blocks, significantly reducing runtime.
*   **🛡️ Misclustering Detection Guardrail (MDG)**: A novel safety mechanism that automatically detects and rejects hallucinatory or illogical clustering outputs from the LLM.
*   **🧩 Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns (Vectorization, Clustering, LLM Interaction, Metrics) for easy maintenance and extensibility.
*   **🔍 Two-Stage Resolution**:
    1.  **Separation**: Splits over-clustered blocks into finer groups.
    2.  **Merging**: Re-evaluates and merges similar groups to ensure high recall.
*   **📊 Comprehensive Metrics**: Automatic calculation of **Purity**, **Inverse Purity**, and **F-Measure**(Adjusted Rand Index).
*   **📝 Smart Logging**: Real-time logging with timestamped files and detailed token usage statistics.

## 📊 Datasets

The repository includes several benchmark datasets for Entity Resolution:

*   **Cora**: Citation data (Author, Title, Venue, Year).
*   **Citesheer**: Scientific publications and citations.
*   **Google-DBLP**: Bibliographic data from Google Scholar and DBLP.
*   **Walmart-Amazon**: Product matching between Walmart and Amazon.
*   **Music20K**: Large-scale music records.
*   **Sigmod**: Database records from SIGMOD.
*   **Affiliation**: Academic affiliation strings.
*   **Song**: Song metadata.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

*   **Python 3.8+**
*   An active **OpenAI API Key**

### 2. Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZJU-DAILY/LLMCER.git
cd LLMCER
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configuration

The project is controlled via the `run.sh` script. You **must** configure your environment variables here before running.

Open `run.sh` and update the following:

```bash
# ==========================================
# Configuration Section
# ==========================================

# 1. OpenAI API Key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."  # <--- Put your actual API Key here

# 2. Dataset Paths
export DATASET_PATH="/abs/path/to/your/dataset.xlsx"
export GROUND_TRUTH_PATH="/abs/path/to/your/ground_truth.txt"

# 3. Model Configuration
# Path to local embedding model or Hugging Face model name
export EMBEDDING_MODEL_PATH="./all-MiniLM-L6-v2" 
export OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-4o-mini"
```

---

## 🖥️ Usage

Once configured, simply execute the shell script to start the pipeline:

```bash
./run.sh
```

### What happens next?

1.  **Vectorization**: The dataset is converted into vector embeddings.
2.  **Blocking**: LSH groups similar records into coarse blocks.
3.  **Separation**: LLM analyzes blocks and splits them into pure clusters.
4.  **Merging**: The system identifies split clusters that belong to the same entity and merges them.
5.  **Validation**: MDG checks ensure structural integrity throughout the process.
6.  **Reporting**: Final metrics and logs are output to the console and `logs/` directory.

## 📊 Output & Logging

### Console Output
You will see real-time progress bars, stage completion status, and a final summary:

```text
========================================
FINAL METRICS REPORT
========================================
Purity:         0.9850
Inverse Purity: 0.9920
F-Measure:      0.9885
----------------------------------------
Total API Calls:     145
Total Execution Time: 45.20 s
Total Tokens:        12500
Total MDG Interventions: 3
========================================
```

### Log Files
Every run generates a detailed log file in `logs/`, named with the dataset and timestamp:
`logs/demo_er_dataset_run_20260111_160914.log`

## 🛠️ Advanced Tuning

You can fine-tune the pipeline by modifying thresholds in `scripts/run_pipeline.py`:

*   `lsh_threshold`: Controls the strictness of the initial blocking.
*   `separation_threshold`: Controls when to split a cluster.
*   `block_threshold` & `merge_threshold`: Control the merging aggressiveness.
